							<p><strong><u>THERMIRF</u></strong></p>
							<p>
									ThermiRF minimally-invasive treatments use targeted radiofrequency
									energy to provide wrinkle reduction , body contouring, lifting and skin
									tightening. ThermiRF treatments are Simple, Safe and Effective. Minimal
									downtime is required after ThermiRF, making it an ideal choice for
									today’s busy, jam-packed lifestyles.
							</p>		
							<p><h6>BENEFITS</h6></p>
							<p><h6>THE BENEFITS OF THERMIRF™ OVER SURGICAL OR INVASIVE PROCEDURES INCLUDE:</h6></p>
							    <ul>
									<li>No surgery</li>
									<li>Minimal to no recovery time</li>
									<li>Minimal discomfort </li>
									<li>Minimal risk of injury</li>
									<li>Safe for all skin types.</li>
								</ul>
							<p><h6>WHAT IS THERMIRF™?</h6></p>
							<p>
								ThermiRF™ is a temperature controlled radio-frequency device used to
								tighten, smooth, and sculpt the skin. Radio-frequency is type of electrical
								energy that can be specifically controlled and thereby delivered very
								accurately to stimulate collagen production in the targeted area. Radio
								frequency energy has been used in medicine extensively, including
								treatments of the heart and nerves in the back for pain management. At
								FACES+, we pride ourselves in bringing patients the latest and most
								innovative cosmetic treatments. Our team of renowned dermatologists now
								offer patients a new minimally-invasive aesthetic treatment! Patients with
								sagging skin, wrinkles, and excess fat deposits can now benefit from the
								revolutionary ThermiLift™ in San Diego.	
							</p>
							<p><h6>WHAT IS THERMIRF™ USED FOR?</h6></p>
							<p>There are 3 different treatments that can be delivered by ThermiRF™:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									Thermi Smooth™ is used to stimulate collagen production to soften lines
									and wrinkles on the face. The Thermi Smooth™ handheld probe delivers
									energy in a temperature controlled fashion and works to soften fine
									lines and wrinkles around the eyes, mouth or other facial areas. It
									promotes three different effects: 1) Immediate contraction of collagen,
									2) Collagen remodeling and stretching, 3) Long-term stimulation
									resulting in new collagen production. The procedure takes 6-8 minutes
									per treatment area (per eye or upper lip) to perform. It is pain-free,
									requires no downtime, and patients leave without any redness or
									bruising. The treatments are gentle, relaxing and feel like a warm
									massage. A series of 3 - 6 treatments are performed a week or so apart
									to achieve optimal cosmetic results.
								</li>
								<li>
									Thermi Tight™ is used to remove excess fat and tighten loose skin on
									the neck or body. Thermi Tight™ is a radio-frequency device that is
									inserted under the skin that works to tighten the connective tissue.
									During the treatment, external and internal temperatures are monitored
									to ensure accuracy, precision, and safety. Thermi Tight™ works by
									heating up the tissue to the optimal temperature which stimulates new
									collagen production. Most procedures last around one hour. Thermi
									Tight™ can be used to treat almost any area of stubborn fat,
									particularly those that don’t respond to diet and exercise, such as
									laxity of the neck and jowls, loose skin on the abdomen, tops of knees,
									thighs, back fat, and under the arms. It has the dual capability of
									both fat removal and skin tightening offering an ideal treatment for
									body contouring and skin tightening without requiring additional
									treatment modalities. Results are typically seen within two to four
									months. Results may vary.This procedure can even be used for axillary
									hyperhidrosis (increased sweating under the arms).
								</li>
								<li>
									Thermi Rase™ is used to relax the frown area giving a long term
									Botox-like effect without any toxins! Thermi Rase™ is a two part
									procedure. The physician first maps the nerves using an external
									stimulator to see the exact location of the nerve pulses. This allows
									for precise lesions to be created during the procedure. The physician
									will inject a local anesthetic, much like a dentist uses, to numb the
									areas. Then, the physician inserts the radio-frequency device under the
									skin to target the nerve. This process is repeated several times until
									the patient is no longer able to make a frown. The entire procedure
									takes around one hour and clinical studies have shown the effects of
									the procedure may last 12 months or more. Results may vary.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p><h6>DOES IT HURT?</h6></p>
							<p>
								We take measures to make the experience as pleasant as possible and the
								treatment is customized based on the procedure and the doctor’s protocol
								(e.g. premedication, numbing.) Patients are relaxed and comfortable during
								the procedure.
								
							</p>
							<p><h6>WHO IS A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR THERMIRF™?</h6></p>
							<p>
								ThermiRF™ is great for what we like to call the “in-between patient”. These
								types of patients are looking for more significant results than
								non-invasive treatments, but they also are not ready to go as far as
								invasive surgery. These patients are looking for faster, longer lasting
								results that look natural.
								
							</p>
							<p><h6>HOW DO I MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE IF THERMIRF™ IS RIGHT FOR ME?</h6></p>
							<p>
								It is important to book a consultation first in order to determine if you
								are a good candidate for the procedure. During your ThermiRF™ consultation,
								the specific areas of concern will be examined and your medical history
								will be reviewed. We will explain the approach for your specific treatment,
								including the risks, benefits, number of sessions you will need and the
								cost. This is the opportunity to have all of your questions answered

							</p>  
					         
							 <p><strong><u>THE MARIONETTE THERMILIFT</u></strong></p>
							<p>  
									Brought to you exclusively by Dr. Tawfik Sefrioui and his team
									immediately saw the need for ThermiRF as an “in between” treatment for
									skin laxity and facial aging. Based on years of experience with other
									types of minimally invasive treatments and surgery for skin tightening,
									“The Marionette ThermiLift »”. This unique and brand new non-surgical
									approach, which is only offered in our office is performed under local
									anesthesia and other than some minor bruising, if any, there is little
									downtime. 
							</p>
							<p><h6>BENEFITS</h6></p>
							<p>
								Immediate results of skin tightening are seen and may be long lasting (2 or
								more years). Repeat procedures may be performed 3-6 months later. In some
								cases, the Marionette ThermiLift may replace the need to have a mini- or
								surgical facelift.
							</p>
							<p><h6> ADDITONAL PROCEDURES</h6></p>
							<p>
								Additional treatments or procedures may be recommended. Packages are
								available that have been scientifically designed to provide the best
								outcomes.
							</p>
							<p><h6>RECOVERY TIME</h6></p>
							<p>
								This unique and brand new non-surgical approach, which is only offered at
								FACES+, is performed under local anesthesia and other than some minor
								bruising, if any, there is couple days downtime in some cases.
							</p>
						       <p><strong> <u>THERMIDRY </u> </strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>
											ThermiDry – monopolar radiofrequency may be an effective treatment for
											excessive underarm sweating which affects many men and women.
											Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) can be virtually eliminated with a
											single treatment under local anesthesia. In addition to sweating, odor
											is reduced and in many cases eliminated. We are is the only center in
											world so far other than in Osaka, Japan that offers the Nomachi
											Protocol for axillary hyperhidrosis.
										</strong>
									</p>
									<p><h6>BENEFITS</h6></p>
									<p>
										In a single minimally invasive procedure, axillary hyperhidrosis can be
										virtually eliminated. Other options such as Botox require multiple
										treatments and ongoing care. MiraDry generally requires multiple treatment
										sessions which are each uncomfortable. Substantial reduction of sweating
										and odor occurs 85% of the time.
									</p>
                                     <p><strong><u>THERMIVA</u></strong></p>
							<p>
								<strong>
									ThermiVa is a new, unique, non-surgical and pain-free treatment for
									mild incontinence, vaginal dryness, loss of soft tissue volume and
									labial laxity. Using a unique radiofrequency gentle probe, non-surgical
									vaginal rejuvenation, along with improvement in sensitivity and
									reduction of symptoms of mild urinary incontinence can be achieved in
									1-3 sessions.
								</strong>
							</p>
							<p><h6>BENEFITS</h6></p>
							<p>
								We are excited to be one of the first practices in Morocco to offer the
								brand-new ThermiVa treatment, an innovative non-invasive vaginal tightening
								device developed by the makers of ThermiTight and ThermiLift. ThermiVa is
								the first non-invasive means to tighten loose vaginal skin, both the outer
								labia and inner vaginal canal. This not only restores the look of the
								vagina, but also helps with problems such as incontinence and lack of
								sexual pleasure due to laxity in the vaginal canal.
							</p>
							<p><h6>HOW DOES THERMIVA WORK?</h6></p>
							<p>
								ThermiVa is a completely non-invasive device that uses radiofrequency
								energy to tighten loose skin. It is based on the same principles as the
								ThermiTight device, which is FDA approved to lift and tighten skin on the
								face and neck. ThermiVa is the first non-surgical vaginal tightening device
								available, and is exciting news for women who are suffering from loose,
								stretched, or enlarged labia and/or vaginal canals but don’t want to
								undergo a surgical labiaplasty. Many women suffer from lax vaginal canals
								and stretched labia, especially after childbirth. This can lead to a number
								of unpleasant side effects, including incontinence, lack of sexual
								pleasure, physical discomfort, and lack of sexual self-confidence. The
								ThermiVa treatment aims to address these issues in a painless, non-surgical
								manner.
							</p>
							<p><h6> WHAT TO EXPECT WITH A THERMIVA TREATMENT?</h6></p>
							<p>
								ThermiVa is a painless procedure that requires no anesthesia or downtime.
								Patients can simply lie back and relax while the innovative S-shaped
								handpiece is moved over the labia and inside the vagina, gently heating and
								tightening the tissue. Patients have described the sensation as a gentle,
								warm massage. The treatment lasts about 30 minutes, and three treatments
								over three months are recommended for full results. Some people see
								immediate improvement directly after a procedure, while others may see
								gradual improvement for around two weeks afterwards. Results last for up to
								a year, and many patients report improved quality of life after a ThermiVa
								treatment. There is no need to live with vaginal laxity following
								childbirth or simply due to age – ThermiVa can help you regain lost
								firmness!

                       <p> <strong> <u>PRP THERAPY (PLATELET RICH PLASMA)</u></strong></p>
						<p>
							
								PRP, or platelet rich plasma, is a substance derived from your own
								blood that contains high levels of platelets, the cells in our blood
								that assist in blood clotting, contain growth factors, and assist in
								cell regeneration. PRP has been used for many years in orthopedic
								medicine and dentistry due to its ability to accelerate healing. More
								recently, PRP has become popular in aesthetic medicine due to its
								ability to stimulate collagen development and cell regeneration. PRP
								can help with a wide array of cosmetic concerns including improvement
								in skin texture, scarring, thickness, and hair loss.
						
						</p>
						<p><h6> WHAT TO EXPECT</h6></p>
						<p>
							Prior to treatment, a blood sample will be taken from you. The blood is
							then placed into a centrifuge which spins the blood and separates the PRP
							from the rest of the blood. The PRP can then be applied to the skin
							topically in conjunction with microneedling or laser, or injected into the
							skin where the platelets create a mesh that stimulates wound healing and
							collagen production over time.
						  
						</p>
						<p><h6>ADDITONAL PROCEDURES</h6></p>
						<p>
							PRP is almost always combined with other treatments such as microneedling,
							laser, fillers, and fat transfer to provide significant improvements in
							skin texture and thickness, scarring, restoration of facial volume and hair
							loss. Please schedule a consultation today to find out if PRP therapy is
							right for you.
						</p>
						<p><h6>  RECOVERY TIME</h6></p>
						<p>
							Recovery time depends on the type of PRP treatment that was performed. The
							downtime for topical PRP and microneedling is usually 1-3 days, topical PRP
							and laser is usually 3-7 days. Patients receiving injectable PRP treatments
							may experience mild bruising and swelling with downtime between 3-5 days.
							Results are visible after several weeks.
						</p>
						<p><h6> HOW MANY TREATMENTS ARE REQUIRED?</h6></p>
						<p>
							For skin rejuvenation, optimal results are seen after 2-3 treatments spaced
							3-4 weeks apart, followed by an annual treatment for maintenance
							thereafter. Patients with more extensive collagen loss will typically need
							a series of 3-4 treatments every 3-4 weeks, followed by maintenance
							treatments twice a year. For hair loss, 3-6 treatments spaced 4 weeks are
							needed. More difficult cases may need additional treatments.

						<p>
							<strong><u>MICRONEEDLING</u></strong>
						</p>
						<p>
								Microneedling, also called collagen induction therapy, is a method of
								skin rejuvenation using a motorized device with multiple fine needles
								to create uniform punctures in the skin surface. The tiny punctures
								created by the needles extend down 0.5–3 mm into the skin and stimulate
								the body to produce new collagen and elastin over time. The result is
								an improvement in skin texture and firmness, reduction in pore size,
								and softening of acne scars and stretch marks.
							
						</p>
						<p> <h6> WHAT TO EXPECT</h6></p>
						<p>
							Your face will be cleansed to remove any makeup and impurities. An
							anesthetic cream will be applied to the entire treatment area for 30-45
							minutes to make the procedure more comfortable. After removal of the
							anesthetic cream, a gel containing skin-stimulating peptides will be
							applied to the treatment area. The microneedling device is then moved
							across the skin surface in multiple directions for 10-15 minutes, creating
							thousands of microscopic channels into the skin and allowing for deeper
							penetration of the peptide gel. Slight bleeding may occur, but this is
							normal and desirable as it indicates stimulation of blood vessels that will
							induce new collagen formation. Following the procedure, a soothing serum
							will be applied to moisturize and protect the skin.
							
						</p>
						<p><h6>ADDITONAL PROCEDURES</h6></p>
						<p>
							Microneedling can be combined with PRP, neurotoxins, fillers, fat transfer
							and skin tightening procedures for even better results based on your
							specific needs. Please schedule a consultation today to find out if
							microneedling is right for you.
							
						</p>
						<p><h6>RECOVERY TIME</h6></p>
						<p>
							Your face will be red following your microneedling treatment, similar to a
							sunburn. Slight bruising or swelling may occur but is less common. For most
							people, these symptoms will resolve within 48-72 hours. Mineral-based
							makeup and sunscreen SPF 30+ can be applied the day after microneedling,
							but products containing retinol or acids (glycolic, salicylic, etc) should
							be avoided for at least 3 days post-treatment.
						</p>
						<p> <h6> HOW MANY TREATMENTS ARE REQUIRED? </h6></p>
						<p>
							Since the results from microneedling are cumulative, multiple treatments
							are strongly encouraged to achieve the best outcome. For skin rejuvenation,
							an initial series of four treatments spaced 3-4 weeks apart is recommended,
							followed by a treatment every 3 months for maintenance. For more difficult
							conditions to treat such as acne scarring or stretch marks, multiple series
							of treatments may be required.

							the number of treatments necessary depends on the number, color, and size
							of the vessels being treated. Since inpidual results vary, ask your
							medical professional about your specific condition.
						</p>
						<p><h6>RECOVERY TIME</h6></p>
						<p>
							Most patients experience a stinging sensation as the pulses of energy are
							delivered through the handpiece. Although no local anesthesia or pain
							medication is typically required, many patients opt to use a topical
							anesthetic prior to treatment. Following the treatment, the pain is minimal
							to nonexistent.

						    							<p><h6> VOLUMA® </h6></p>
							<p>
								As you age, it’s not just about lines and wrinkles. Your cheeks can lose
								volume and skin may begin to sag. JUVÉDERM VOLUMA® XC is the first
								FDA-approved injectable gel to instantly add volume to your cheek area to
								correct age-related volume loss in adults over the age of 21. It can
								provide you contour and a subtle lift for up to two years with optimal
								treatment.
							</p>
							<p><h6>FAT GRAFTING AND STEM CELLS</h6></p>
							<p>
								The use of adipose tissue, which is rich in stem and regenerative cells has
								undergone a renaissance in the reconstructive and aesthetic surgery.
								Enriched fat injections is a procedure whereby a patient’s fat tissue is
								enriched with his or her own regenerative cells to create a natural filler.
								The applications are widespread with potential benefits in breast
								augmentation, facial cosmetics, breast reconstruction and contour
								deformities from a variety of acquired and congenital disorders
							</p>
							<p> <h6> RADIESSE®</h6></p>
							<p>
								Radiesse® (Radiance) is a pure, synthetic compound with a record of safety
								that extends more than 25 years. It is comprised of microspheres of calcium
								hydroxylapatite, combined with an aqueous gel. The key element of Radiesse®
								is identical to the chemical structure of calcium naturally present in the
								human body. Throughout its life, Radiesse® remains soft and flexible and
								also exceptionally compatible with the body.
							<br/>
								Unlike temporary treatments that must be repeated, Radiesse® may provide
								years of rejuvenation. However, the resorption rate is variable and we have
								had some patients in whom the material was gone by 6 months. It is
								gradually replaced by the body’s own tissue, and slowly dissolves away in
								some cases up to seven years later. Radiesse® is FDA-approved for soft
								tissue marking in any anatomical location, vocal cord injection and oral
								and maxillofacial augmentation. FDA approval for facial implant is pending.
								Internationally, Radiesse has received approval for facial implant and
								treatment of stress urinary incontinence.
							</p>
							<p><h6> JUVEDERM®  </h6></p>
							<p>
								As we age, our skin changes. Over time, the natural volume of youthful skin
								begins to diminish as wrinkles and folds form. But, with Juvederm®
								injectable gel, you don’t have to just sit back and let it happen! Approved
								by the FDA, Juvederm® injectable gel is a “next-generation” dermal filler.
								The smooth consistency gel helps to instantly restore your skin’s volume
								and smooth away facial wrinkles and folds, like your “smile lines” or
								“parentheses” (nasolabial folds – the creases that run from the bottom of
								your nose to the corners of your mouth).
							<br/>
								Juvederm® is a smooth consistency gel made of hyaluronic acid – a naturally
								occurring substance in your skin that helps to add volume and hydration.
								Your healthcare professional eases Juvederm® injectable gel under the skin
								to provide a smooth, natural look and feel – so everyone will notice (but
								no one will know)! In fact, studies show superior results of Juvederm®
								compared to a popular collagen-based dermal filler. And, almost 90% of all
								study volunteers who were treated with both Juvederm® injectable gel and
								another popular dermal filler preferred Juvederm®! In addition, Juvederm®
								injectable gel is the first FDA-approved hyaluronic acid dermal filler that
								is proven to be safe and effective for persons of color.
							</p>
							<p><h6> RESTYLANE® </h6></p>
							<p>
								Restylane® is a crystal-clear, non-animal, biodegradable gel based on a
								natural substance, called hyaluronic acid. The gel is injected into the
								skin in tiny amounts with a very fine needle. The result is instantaneous
								and produces a long-lasting, natural enhancement that is gentle and safe to
								your skin.
							<br/>
								Restylane will last from 6 to 12 months and is very effective for
								diminishing wrinkles around the corners of the mouth, the lips, the
								nasolabial folds and the frown lines. Restylane is also an excellent
								temporary filler for lip augmentation. Experience shows that it is
								effective for up to six months when injected in the lips. Restylane is a
								long-lasting, but not permanent, result, leaving you the option of
								adjusting your treatment in tune with changing taste and fashion.
							</p>
							<p><h6>BOTOX COSMETIC </h6></p>
							<p>
								BOTOX® Cosmetic injections are one of the most frequent procedures we
								perform our department of Skin and Laser Center. Botox Cosmetic injections
								are a highly diluted derivative of Botulinum Toxin Type A, which relaxes
								the muscles that cause wrinkling by blocking the release of acetylcholine,
								the chemical that causes muscles to contract. Although F.D.A. approved in
								2002, Plastic surgeons and dermatologists have been using Botox Cosmetic to
								treat facial wrinkles such as crow’s feet and frown lines for 10 years.
							<br/>
								Botox Cosmetic injections are a great way to reduce your facial wrinkles.
								With continued use of Botox Cosmetic your wrinkles may actually lessen and
								may disappear for prolonged periods of time. Most people come in 2-3 times
								per year for Botox Cosmetic injections.
							</p>
							<p><h6> WRINKLE FILLERS </h6></p>
							<p>
								Many wrinkle fillers are on the market today and more are being introduced
								at a very rapid rate. It is getting difficult to tell one filler from
								another. Often, it is like the “flavor of the week” from a patient’s
								perspective. Dr. Tawfik Sefrioui is a recognized authority on fillers and
								lectures internationally on the principles and uses of wrinkle fillers.
							<br/>
								We are here to help you decipher the differences in fillers and to make an
								intelligent decision for your own particular concerns. Basically, there are
								3 types of fillers available today. There are temporary, longer-lasting,
								and permanent fillers that are made from a wide range of substances. The
								most widely used temporary fillers are Juvederm and Restylane. Radience (or
								Radiesse) and Sculptra are longer-lasting in many cases, but not permanent.
								They tend to last from 6-9 months up to 2 years.
